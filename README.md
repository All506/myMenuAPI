Â `This is a personal projec I've been working on almost every night since July, 29th, 2025. As soon as it is finished, it will be part of my portfolio.
 No tutorials have been followed as this is a 100% personal project focus to strength my abilities in nodejs. A React Front might be implemented later on.`
